      <h2>Vivaldi's The Four Seasons</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> OCT 14-16 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor Aram Demirjian present a powerhouse program highlighted by Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter through music that manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its debut. Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert Hall.</p>
      <p>The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate that endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements, Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of humanity’s most powerful works of art. Among today’s best and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit of dance, movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of your seat.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Aram Demirjian, conductor; Paul Huang, violin</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> JESSIE MONTGOMERY Strum, VIVALDI The Four Seasons, Op. 8, No. 1-4, TCHAIKOVSKY Symphony No. 4 in F minor, Op. 36</p>

      <h2>Beethoven Symphony No. 3 with Peter Oundjian</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> NOV 4-6 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>History is replete with turning points and with the completion of his revolutionary Third Symphony, Beethoven forever changed the idea of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is larger and more emotional than a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to the forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very nature of humanity, while reimagining a future for music filled with endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring themes and quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes center stage on Vaughan Williams’ Walt Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable marriage of music and text, with Williams’ inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman’s noble, humanistic aspirations. These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your Colorado Symphony.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Peter Oundjian, conductor; Sterling Elliott, cello; Colorado Symphony Chorus, Duain Wolfe, director</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> VAUGHAN WILLIAMS Toward the Unknown Region, ELGAR Cello Concerto in E minor, Op. 85, BEETHOVEN Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, Op. 55 “Eroica”</p>

      <h2>Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Olga Kern</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> DEC 2-4 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic compositions — placed himself among the greats of the keyboard with the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with towering grandeur, gorgeously lyrical melodies, and unmistakable Romantic spirit. For pianists what Everest is to climbers, the Concerto in B-flat has become the standard against which all virtuosos must measure themselves, featuring iconic opening flourishes and a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite Olga Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this cornerstone of the Classical Canon. Your Colorado Symphony and Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” by the San Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s stormy and brooding Tenth Symphony. Written to symbolize the power of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and complex orchestrations that mirror his own battles against Soviet oppression. Ending on a triumphant note, this is a finale that will leave you breathless.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Christian Reif, conductor; Olga Kern, piano</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> TCHAIKOVSKY Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat major, Op. 23, SHOSTAKOVICH Symphony No. 10 in E minor, Op. 93</p>

      <h2>Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> JAN 13-15 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>Be still my heart! A whirling celebration of pagan love awaits listeners with Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, which he called a “symphonie chorégraphique” rather than a ballet, reflecting a sense of powerful, dramatic music which defies category and springs to life on terms all its own. Ravel’s exceptional score creates a sensuous atmosphere with a lingering explosiveness residing just underneath the surface. Scored for a massive orchestra and utilizing the ethereal, intangible tones of a wordless chorus, Ravel often spotlights solo players in a way that recalls chamber music rather than merely using it as a show of force, pulling listeners into a vast, visceral dreamscape of shimmering colors and hypnotic motion. Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto will shine in the hands of Concertmaster Yumi Hwang-Williams, who brings expressive virtuosity to one of the first violin concertos of the modern era. The program opens with Lili Boulanger’s D'un matin de printemps, meaning ‘On a spring morning,’ capturing the genius of this prodigious composer who wrote over 50 compositions before tragically passing at the age of just 24. This sweet and playful ode to spring is just the transportive overture to carry away your winter doldrums.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Kevin John Edusei, conductor; Yumi Hwang-Williams, violin; Colorado Symphony Chorus, Duain Wolfe, director</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> BOULANGER D'un matin de printemps, SZYMANOWSKI Violin Concerto No. 1, Op. 35, RAVEL Daphnis et Chloé</p>

      <h2>Beethoven Symphony No. 8</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> FEB 10-12 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>Beethoven’s Eighth — which he referred to as “my little Symphony in F,” — is the most cheery, joyful, and experimental of his symphonies. Its relatively compact scale allowed Beethoven to be more imaginative and structurally radical than he could dare to be on the larger canvases of his other symphonies. Light-hearted and full of charm, the Eighth is an often-overlooked gem that will shine under the baton of Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon. Celebrate the Colorado Symphony Horns as they take center stage on Schumann’s Konzertstück for 4 Horns and Orchestra, incorporating the warmth, nobility, and hunting-horn origins of German Romantic-era music while conjuring images of the unspoiled forests of the German landscape. In an ironic twist, the performance begins with a “Farewell,” harkening back to the piece’s debut when Haydn instructed his musicians to stop playing one by one during the final movement, snuff out the candle on their music stand, and walk off the stage in turn, leaving just two violins to convey the final notes. In this uniquely imaginative performance, seeing is believing.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Christopher Dragon, conductor; Colorado Symphony Horn Section: Michael Thornton, Kolio Plachkov, Carolyn Kunicki, Matt Eckenhoff</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> HAYDN Symphony No. 45 in F-sharp minor, “Farewell,” R. SCHUMANN Konzertstück for 4 Horns and Orchestra in F major, Op. 86, BEETHOVEN Symphony No. 8 in F major, Op. 93</p>

      <h2>Debussy’s La Mer & Ravel’s La Valse</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> MAR 3-5 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>Few works have so captured the imagination of audiences as Debussy’s La Mer, which the composer called “three symphonic sketches” — an impressionistic ode to the sea inspired by the composer’s childhood memories and his love of art. Sweeping, swirling, and ever-changing, La Mer recalls the many moods of the sea in a work that stands as a monument of early 20th century music. Also inspired by dance, Ravel’s La Valse weaves sumptuous music in a phantasmagorical tribute to the Viennese waltz, incorporating themes and orchestrations that perfectly blend beauty and the macabre. The evening begins with the Colorado Symphony’s performance of the beautiful overture to the only comic opera by Beethoven, the exuberant and whimsical Fidelio. Paired with Lalo’s Symphonie espagnole, the evening features soloist Maria Dueñas, who was the first prize winner of the 2021 Yehudi Menuhin Competition, illustrating once again why her extraordinary talent has become the talk of the classical music world.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Peter Oundjian, conductor; María Dueñas, violin</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> BEETHOVEN Fidelio Overture, Op. 72b, LALO Symphonie espagnole in D minor, Op. 21, DEBUSSY La Mer, RAVEL La Valse</p>

      <h2>Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> APR 7-9 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>Sergei Prokofiev’s brilliant Fifth Symphony embodies the spirit of the Russian people and remains one of his most popular works. Written during the summer of 1944, Prokofiev’s aim was to write a symphony that extolled the grandeur of the human spirit, exhibiting beauty, strength, and heroism. From the majestic opening movement to the soaring Finale, the Fifth Symphony is a tour de force of orchestration and a work that is unmistakably Prokofiev. The Colorado Symphony Chorus, under the direction of Duain Wolfe, begins the evening with Stravinsky’s Symphony of Psalms, a work that captures both the majesty and humility of the Psalm texts. The program also features pianist Michelle Cann, who brings dynamic vitality to Florence Price’s Piano Concerto in One Movement. With an engaging and fiery presence, Price’s pioneering compositional voice melds European traditions with melodies and rhythms inspired by African American folk music.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Peter Oundjian, conductor; Michelle Cann, piano; Colorado Symphony Chorus, Duain Wolfe, director</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> STRAVINSKY Symphony of Psalms, PRICE Piano Concerto in One Movement, PROKOFIEV Symphony No. 5 in B-flat major, Op. 100</p>

      <h2>Brahms Symphony No. 4</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> MAY 12-14 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>Johannes Brahms never let go of the past, often incorporating it into his works, and that influence is on full display in his Fourth and final Symphony. The work culminates with a magnificent passacaglia — a series of variations over a repeated bass — that nods to J.S. Bach, with themes built on beautiful, long-spun melodies, allowing Brahms to reach the height of his orchestral powers. This performance is the perfect showcase for the immense talents of Music Director Peter Oundjian, who begins the evening with one of Ginastera’s most famous works, Variaciones concertantes, featuring a series of brilliant solos from musicians throughout the orchestra, before diving into one of Haydn’s greatest symphonies. His Symphony No. 99 was written for the second of his two highly successful trips to London, illustrating why his inventive, buoyant works remain ever-endearing.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Peter Oundjian, conductor</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> GINASTERA Variaciones concertantes, Op. 23, HAYDN Symphony No. 99 in E-flat major, BRAHMS Symphony No. 4 in E minor, Op. 98</p>

      <h2>Fate and Fantasy</h2>
      <p><strong>Dates:</strong> MAY 26-28 FRI-SAT 7:30, SUN 1:00</p>
      <p>In Rachmaninoff’s hands, few things in life are as memorable and affirming as the sound of a piano. With melodies rich in character and complexity, his Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini is one of the most beloved works for piano and orchestra. Featuring the 18th variation that stands among the most enduring and well-known themes of the 20th century, the piece will spring to life with British pianist Stephen Hough’s dynamic virtuosity. The evening opens with Dvořák’s Carnival Overture, a colorful, life-affirming work that begins with the thrill of the carnival and ends on a lively note. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes center stage on Vaughan Williams’ Fantasia on the “Old 104th” Psalm Tune, a remarkable marriage of music and text, with Williams’ inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman’s noble, humanistic aspirations.</p>
      <p><strong>Featured Artists:</strong> Peter Oundjian, conductor; Stephen Hough, piano; Colorado Symphony Chorus, Duain Wolfe, director</p>
      <p><strong>Repertoire:</strong> DVOŘÁK Carnival Overture, Op. 92, VAUGHAN WILLIAMS Fantasia on the “Old 104th” Psalm Tune, RACHMANINOFF Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 43</p>
